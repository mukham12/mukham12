👋 Hello, I'm Muhammad!

👀 I have a strong interest in a variety of technologies including Python, JavaScript (React & React Native), Java (including Spring, Spring Boot and Jackson).

🌱 I am always seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. In addition to my coursework, I have already been contributing to open source projects like the Jackson Java library to gain experience and improve my skills.

💻 I have experience working on a range of projects, both individually and in teams. I am adept at problem-solving, debugging, and writing clean, efficient code. I am also a quick learner and enjoy tackling new challenges.

🚀 As someone who is passionate about technology, I am excited about the potential of using cutting-edge tools to create innovative solutions. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the field.

📨 If you have a project in mind that you think I would be a good fit for or if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to contact me at muhammadkhalikov@gmail.com.

Thank you for visiting my profile! 🙏
